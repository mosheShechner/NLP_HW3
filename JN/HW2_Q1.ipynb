    "Syntactic parsing is an NLP task that sets it's goal to parse a language sentence to its syntactic parts; <br>\n",
    "A common method to generate a sentence segmentation to it's syntactic parts is via construction of context free grammer that cpature the language rules; We note that a natural language is not context free, therefore a context free grammer (that is not very large) cannot capture all the behaviours, but we may construct a gradually increasing set of CFG grammer rules that will incresingly capture more and more natural gramatical phenomenon;<br>\n",
